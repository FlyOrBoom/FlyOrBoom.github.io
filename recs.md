## Textbooks & high-quality notes

Unless marked by ?, these are documents that I have read significant portions of and found helpful in my studies. They are roughly sorted by stars in their difficulty. Their categories are approximate, and get increasingly blended with each other at the more advanced levels.

\* light: no prerequisites \
\*\* introductory: requires some mathematical maturity \
\*\*\* medium: a more sophisticated second exposure \
\*\*\*\* advanced: requires specialized mathematical background \
\*\*\*\*\* hella advanced

![Six swirling mathematical equations in a grid](/media/ripple-weave-collage-w720.png)

Nested trigonometric functions mapped onto HSL space. Some really pretty ones were published on [IMAGINARY](https://www.imaginary.org/gallery/ripple-weave). Play around for yourself at [xingyzt.net/rippleweave](https://xingyzt.net/rippleweave)!

Very much a direct consequence of messing around with Desmos, bored in math class. Inspired by the work done in Shadertoy, though this is more limited, and in turn gives a bit more control.

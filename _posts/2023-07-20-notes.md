My notes for the first two parts of Carroll & Ostlie's "Big Orange Book", 
written in a combination of markdown and LaTeX for the optimal mix of 
accessibility and mathematical typesetting, are available at
[xingyzt.net/notes/intro-to-modern-astrophysics](https://xingyzt.net/notes/intro-to-modern-astrophysics). Enjoy!

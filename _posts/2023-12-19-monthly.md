get to pick a few things out of an \
infinitude to savor is kinda neat

reads:
- Deniz Türker. [*The Accidental Palace: The Making of Yıldız in Nineteenth-Century Istanbul*.](https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-09391-8.html)
  - The residence of the last Ottoman sultan before his empire's fall.
- Matthew McQuinn. ["The Evolution of the Intergalactic Medium."](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-astro-082214-122355)
  - The stuff between all the universe's bright lights!
    
    When we try to picture the cosmos, we tend to only think about the shiny stuff --- 
    stars, galaxies, and very very hungry black holes. But just as there's much more grass
    on the plains than sheep, and much more water in the seas than fish, the background 
    medium of the universe turns out to far, *far* outweigh the stars!
    Though admittedly, they aren't as sparkley.
  
    This medium contains loose gas, dust, and most mysteriously, *dark matter*. (more to come)
- Cade Metz et al. ["Ego, Fear and Money: How the A.I. Fuse Was Lit"](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/technology/ai-openai-musk-page-altman.html)
  - These people have strange sights for the future.

Revolutions in physics are forever memorialized by the dichotomies they introduce.
While the hot new topics are given trendy labels of “quantum” or “relativistic” or whatnot,
the old established players are relegated to the catch-all drawer of “classical stuff”.
As with all human endeavors in categorizing things, these divisions should not be interpreted too rigidly.
Some of the most interesting work in physics is done at their intersections.
Conversely, these relatively modern divisions should not be regarded as the only useful ones.
I want to bring up a less glamorized, yet no less important dichotomy which cuts across the more popular labels: 
the discrete versus the continuous.

To motivate this discussion, let’s talk about quantum field theory, or rather, the spooky allure it has to underinformed freshmen like me.
Before coming to college, I had only ever associated the mysterious “QFT” as some vague concept possibly useful in particle physics. 
It felt far removed from any physics I had done or was ever planning to do --- 
After all, high school didn’t exactly teach quantum mechanics, let alone field theories, or so I thought.

I did not know that linear algebra, for all its talk on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forms the basis for quantization;
Nor did I realize that electromagnetism, for all its talk of the electric and magnetic fields, is a classical field theory!

Over the years, I’ve come to realize that the barrier for me to learn new areas of physics is generally not my mathematical skills
(a solid grasp of multivariable calculus and linear algebra is sufficient for most things) or conceptual understanding
(science YouTubers and Wikipedia are more than enough for that), but the ability to somehow connect them together;
to *know* how the things I’m learning now prepare me for the off-chance that I decide to study theoretical physics.

Which brings us back to my point about categories --- they should never be treated as very sharp and hard-to-cross borders.
(There’s an interesting parallel here to periodization in historiography that my amazing history professors are way more qualified to talk about.)
And while part of this is just naivité, I think physics educators should also communicate the connections better.

One can add more transitional steps, like what [Hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/index.html) is doing:

But to better organize the bigger picture, I believe we just ought to come up with more dichotomies than the trendy nonrelativistic-relativistic
and classical-quantum duals. It’s like how points on a page can be put closer together if we can crumble the paper into 3D:
more broad categories reveals more connections.

So let’s talk about the discrete-vs-continuous dichotomy, a.k.a. particles-vs-fields, or few-things-vs-lots-of-things.

I should clarify that I, like most things, am a transient phenomenon.
I think that’s a pretty defining trait. The work we do will be lost to Physics 112 eventually.
It’ll be rather funny that there’s a blip in the cosmic strata for all this creation though.

and also,

- I like to art. From childhood I've played with drawing stuff, 
nature in particular, so that's the type of art I've mostly stuck to.
As I picked up programming, I've incoporated bits and pieces of
generative code into the canvas.
Maybe I'll experiment with writing and music sometime too,
though it'll be quite a while before I get good at them.

- I like studying the fundamentals of the universe. It's a weird 
time to want to join the field. Bigger and bigger experiments.
Stranger and stranger math. Overall, the world is making less sense than ever.
I wonder what'll happen soon.

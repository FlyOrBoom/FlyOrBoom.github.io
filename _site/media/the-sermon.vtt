[footsteps]

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.086
- You've got to put your phone away Cecily!

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:20.849
I really don't see why *you* should keep a phone at all.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.644
- I keep a phone in order to share my life

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:25.770
with all of my thousands of wonderful friends.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.490
If I didn't do that,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.734
I should probably forget about all of them.

00:00:30.737 --> 00:00:32.664
- Well why don't you just bring them to church—

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:34.221
- It's because they're heretics!

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.905
- Oh please doctor, I'm just sayin'

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.910
I am *not* in favor of this modern mania

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.920
of posting everything you do to this "social media" thing.

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.087
The mouth, my dear Cecily,

00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:46.935
Is the method of socialization we all carry about with us.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.023
Isn't that right, Merriman?

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:50.678
- Uhh... sure!

00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:52.131
That's right Miss!

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:54.755
Societal medium is perfectly horrid!

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:58.864
- Plus, your life is too improper to be shared.

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:00.506
You need to learn proper ettiquette!

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:01.631
- But—
- Shush!

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:03.854
Doctor's sermon is about to start!

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:06.101
How perfectly disgraceful!

00:01:07.253 --> 00:01:08.461

- Today we gather in mourning

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.784 line:0
 of Mr. George Bunbury.

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:15.498
- Aren't you the one who confused

00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:17.241 line:0
- born in 1854

00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:17.241
a baby for a handbag?

00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.293 line:0
he got his first cold at the age of 5 days

00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:21.942
- It was a very nice handbag!

00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:23.725
Ernest should be thankful for having

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:26.393
such an expensive home!

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:28.017 line:0
Thereafter, he has suffered every disease imaginable:

00:01:26.393 --> 00:01:29.070
Besides, you are being very disrespectful.

00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:31.539 line:0
typhus, smallpox, syphylis,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.409
*I* am supposed to be the one

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.539
criticizing *you*!

00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:32.911 line:0
and the Plague.

00:01:33.946 --> 00:01:35.633 line:0
But until last week,

00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:38.242 line:0
God had given him mercy each time.

00:01:39.162 --> 00:01:41.468 line:0
It was a humble case of cholera

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.375 line:0
that finally arrested his life

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.717 line:0
at the age of 41. 

00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:49.555 line:0
Now, let us talk about his mana...

00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:49.555
[fades into music]

00:01:50.363 --> 00:01:50.719

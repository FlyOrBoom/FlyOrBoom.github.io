&lt;p&gt;I like to tell the creation story of numbers, something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let a Set which bounds nothing and excludes everything be named Zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let every Set after it bind together the preceding Set, and a Set of the preceding Set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this simple duet, a floodgate to the Naturals opens. One is the Set which bounds the Zero; Two is the set which bounds Zero, One, and Two. So on and so forth. A countable infinity of numerals, each unique and orderable, born from drawing boundaries between Insides and Outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the Negatives, first examine their true nature: the difference between two naturals. To make Negative One, bind together One and Two, or Two and Three, or Three and Four… The floodgates now point in two directions, and the Integers were born.
.
Rationals are pairs of Integers, bound in fractions. Half is One and Two, or Two and Four, or Three and Six… The steppes of numbers become smooth slopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reals are harder to define: A pair of two infinite sets of Rationals, one binding all that’s less than the Real, the other binding all that’s more. They race like Zeno towards each other, converging from opposite ends, Negative and Positive Infinities, after an eternity, onto their final destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair the two Reals, and out come the Complexes. Pair four, Quaternions. Pair every number in an infinity of them to another to get maps and functions. Flip the definitions on their heads to get p-adic numbers, a separate breed of beasts who behave like nothing else. From a set, a universe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="story" /><summary type="html">They call the piece a Set, the basic boundary between an Inside and an Outside.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Polarizar: Visual odometry for the 2023 FTC robotics competition</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/code/robotics/2023/02/12/polarizar.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polarizar: Visual odometry for the 2023 FTC robotics competition" /><published>2023-02-12T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-02-12T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/code/robotics/2023/02/12/polarizar</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/code/robotics/2023/02/12/polarizar.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem: Our robot needs to precisely navigate a field of poles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/media/polarizar-w720.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odometry is a critical component of any fast and precise Autonomous program. In designing our Autonomous strategy, we considered several conventional means of odometry, but discarded every single one for their flaws: Inertial Measurement Units suffer from significant drift during integration; Encoder odometry can be very precise on the short scales, but lack the accuracy for navigating around multiple poles; And while distance sensors can detect poles to high precision, they lack a wide field of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we decided to explore visual odometry instead, which allows our robot to know its position and orientation on the field from the camera alone. This approach is especially useful for this FTC season due to the lattice of highly visible poles on the field. The plan was this: track the positions of poles in the camera, convert them into coordinates on the field, and from them, compute the motion of the robot. In between poles, encoders can then provide more precise positions on top of visual odometry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our specific pole recognition odometry strategy was, as far as we know, completely novel, we embarked on this project with low-level OpenCV. We first prototyped programs in Python on laptop, which was faster to debug and iterate. Our first experiment was determining the positions of cones on a table from a laptop camera: He learned to project the table onto a plane, then isolate the colors to find the centers of red and blue contours, producing accurate positions for the cones. We then applied the technique to the field: Isolating the yellow poles and projecting their lowest points onto a square plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first planned to calculate the robot’s motion from the relative frame-by-frame changes in each pole’s position. However, this approach faced IMU-like integration drift over time: if the robot moved in a circle, its calculated position would not end up where it started. After a divine revelation from semi-nude men, we realized we could measure the poles’ absolute position from “ground-truth” measurements instead: This was not easy, because only two to three poles are visible in our off-the-shelf webcam, so there is little data to match them with the 18 ground-truth poles. However, past position estimates can crudely align them closely enough to match and calculate the absolute difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the algorithm in its entirety: First, we identify the poles by color. Then, we project them onto a field-sized square plane. Next, we shift them by the last estimated robot position to match them with the absolute positions of the ground-truth poles. Finally, we calculate the difference to update the estimated robot position. Because this approach always measures against the ground truth, errors do not accumulate over time. There is noise from camera shakes and uncertain pole identification, but as long as two or more poles stay in the field of view at all times, we can obtain an accurate position of the robot from the camera alone, and the average error stays constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be further improved with sensor fusion: using IMUs and encoders on top of our undrifting visual odometry increases precision between poles, and distance sensors help with exact alignment directly in front of poles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="code" /><category term="robotics" /><summary type="html">The problem: Our robot needs to precisely navigate a field of poles.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">really bad Gilgamesh scifi fanfiction</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/story/2022/10/02/gigamesh.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="really bad Gilgamesh scifi fanfiction" /><published>2022-10-02T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-10-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/story/2022/10/02/gigamesh</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/story/2022/10/02/gigamesh.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Space Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A worn-out interceptor floats alone in the outskirts of the Cosmic Café parking lot, its rusty, bullet-hole-littered frame dimly reflecting the neon glow from the faraway restaurant. An ancient mercenary sits gloomily in the cockpit. Gilgamesh, veteran of the Great Plutonic Wars, is drinking to forget. His glory days were gone; his pay, gone. Just fired from his last job, he’s all by himself this lonely night; Struggling to shake out the last drops of moonshine; His rocky body, whose inertia had crushed Charonian armor, now too heavy to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thundering jolt shakes Gilgamesh out of his slumber. Out to the left of his window, a blue Spacefarer had crashed into his interceptor. Gilgamesh curses in rage and climbs out of the cockpit. He leaps onto the intruding ship and drags out its pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who the hell are you to ram into my ship like that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m gravely sorry, sir. I’m Enkidu, I’m just a poor worker here. I was just drivin’ to work my night shift—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know how much this ship costs? And you, just goddamn slams into it like a blind latel!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry but I didn’t see any lights on you. And my headlight’s broken too. Please, it’s all an accident. And I’m a poor man, you see. I’ve got no money to pay—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh you’re goddamn payin’ all right! You’re not leavin’ here til you do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh please. Look what junk I have! I swear I’ve got no money on me besides a few coins. You want pay? Your ass has better chances picking on Humbaba!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, a very crappy transition to exposition of Humbaba&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The hell’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Livin’ under a rock this past decade? There’s a monster who took over one of the planets the Plutonians nuked. Humbar, ’bout as big as Mercury, was earmarked for mining before the war. But during the Siege of Dove, our commander decided to scorch the Earth rather than let the Charons have it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That bastard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That Humbar’s so rich in transuranium it could power a thousand tankers for a century each. But now, this freakin’ mountain-sized megaorganism roams its shores!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well then, if you know so much, go defeat it and pay me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You crazy? Hundreds have tried! The army even sent an expeditionary force once. But Humbaba guards Humbar like a black hole. No one’s ever returned.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t care. You wronged me and you need to goddamn pay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh bloody hell! Look at you! You’re a warrior! You’ve been through some real shit. I’ve done fights in the asteroid slums but hell if I have to kill an actual monster. Want money to bandage up your junk of a warship? Go fight Humbaba yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t want to pay eh?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment Gilgamesh relents. But he still feels injustice boiling in his veins. A need to punish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fine, you wuss. But you’re guiding me there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he hauls Enkidu onboard the interceptor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They head to Humbar at full speed. In 3 Sols they’ve reached the planet of no return. In 3 Sols, Enkidu had chatted up Gilgamesh, and they now at least accept each other’s presence. Now the purple planet is hovering above their heads. The monster, a slithering mass, occasionally peaks its head above the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They de-orbit into Humbar’s atmosphere. For three minutes their ship violently shakes as it plunges into thick air for the first time in a year. The pungent smell of a beast’s breath diffuses into the recharging life support system. The engine cut out a minute too early, and Gilgamesh crash-landed his craft into a mudpool a kilometer behind the monster’s back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve awaken Humbaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its tail unfurls itself across the plains. Sweeping a giant arc before them, it ignites a chain of sonic booms that knocks the ship on its side. Gilgamesh and Enkidu hurriedly climb out, plasma pikes in  one hand, neutronium shields in the other. Enkidu frightened, but Gilgamesh determined, to fight this monster and claim the riches to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humbaba’s ears notice the irregularities in the shockwaves’ echo. She turns her head, slowly scanning across the horizon. But the men know they have been found. By the time she spots their spacecraft, they’re running straight towards her head. Humbaba snarls. They lunge at her with all their might. But Humbaba makes a great meow, and transforms into a winged cat. She lifts into the air and stomps down at the two men. They block with their shields, but their bodies are compressed to the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when Humbaba thought the men have been killed, Enkidu rolls out from under and spears her eyes. Gilgamesh ran up her back and slits her neck. With a great, deafening sound Humbaba fell onto the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monster destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
